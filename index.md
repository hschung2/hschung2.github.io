## About Me

I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Omnious AI located in Seoul, South Korea. Previously, I received my Master’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from POSTECH under the supervision of Prof. Minsu Cho. I also completed my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My research interests broadly include recommendation systems, applications of reinforcement learning, and integration of foundation models. Specifically, I am interested in 1) designing sample-efficient training algorithms for recommendation systems, 2) tackling combinatorial optimization problems with reinforcement learning, and 3) leveraging LLM into enhanced recommendations.
