## 💻 About Me

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with over three years of experience, currently working at Omnious AI located in Seoul, South Korea. Previously, I received my Master’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from POSTECH, as well as my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Throughout my career, I have collaborated extensively with cross-functional teams, including engineers, product managers, designers, and fellow researchers, to develop integrated, high-impact solutions that drive technological advancements and product innovation.

My research interests encompass recommendation systems, reinforcement learning applications, and the integration of foundational models. Nowadays, I am interested in: 1) designing sample-efficient training algorithms for recommendation systems, 2) addressing combinatorial optimization challenges with reinforcement learning, and 3) leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance recommendation systems.
